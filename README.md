Just Paste all in one into the console terminal. It creates a `Llama` folder on your Desktop containing the config, personality file, and models directory, plus a desktop launcher. Everything is linked and works together.

Go into `llama-config.txt`, set the `CURRENT_MODEL` to a Hugging Face model URL (or publisher/modelname), then double-click the launcher. The script handles all dependencies, builds llama.cpp with HTTPS support, and manages everything with no bulky overhead like Python or Ollama and no servers for security.

## What Gets Created

* **Launch-Llama.desktop** – Desktop launcher icon to start the chat session
* **Desktop/Llama/llama-config.txt** – Model selection and all generation settings
* **Desktop/Llama/personality.txt** – AI system prompt / personality
* **Desktop/Llama/models/** – Downloaded models are automatically stored and cached here

## First Launch

1. Open `Desktop/Llama/llama-config.txt`
2. Paste a HuggingFace GGUF model URL or `publisher/modelname` after `CURRENT_MODEL=`
3. (Optional) Adjust any generation or performance settings
4. Double-click **Launch-Llama.desktop** to start
5. The model will download on first use, then run fully offline

The config file automatically updates with a list of all installed models for easy switching.

### Easy txt Settings

* **THREADS**          * CPU threads
* **TEMP**             * Temperature
* **CONTEXT**          * Context window size in tokens
* **MAX_TOKENS**       * Maximum tokens to generate (-1 = no limit)
* **BATCH_SIZE**       * Prompt processing batch size
* **REPEAT_PENALTY**   * Repetition penalty
* **TOP_K**            * Top-K sampling
* **TOP_P**            * Top-P (nucleus) sampling
* **MIN_P**            * Min-P sampling
* **SEED**             * Random seed (-1 = random each run)
* **REASONING_BUDGET** * Max allowed reasoning for reasoning models (0 = off)
* **FLASH_ATTN**       * Flash Attention for faster inference and lower memory use
* **MLOCK**            * Lock model in RAM
* **EMOJI_ALLOW**      * Allow or restrict emojis by forcing ASCII

### AI Personality
Edit `Desktop/Llama/personality.txt` to customize the system prompt.

## Performance Tips

* Start with smaller models (1-3B parameters) for best speed on Raspberry Pi 5
* Reduce `CONTEXT` if you run out of memory
* Lower `BATCH_SIZE` (e.g. 256) on slower systems
* `FLASH_ATTN=auto` is usually the best setting
* Enable `MLOCK=true` if you have enough free RAM

## Offline Operation
Once downloaded, models run completely offline. They are cached in `Llama/models/` and reused on future launches.
